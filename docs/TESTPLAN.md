## Notes for Stakeholder Review

1. **Test Environment**: These tests assume a fresh application session starting with a balance of $1,000.00
2. **Data Reset**: The application resets balance data on each session (no persistent database)
3. **Input Validation**: The system validates numeric menu selections (1-4) and rejects invalid choices
4. **Amount Precision**: All amounts support two decimal places (cents)
5. **Overdraft Protection**: The system prevents any debit that would result in a negative balance
6. **Error Messages**: Clear error messages displayed for invalid operations

## Migration to Node.js - Test Mapping

These test cases are designed to be migrated to Node.js unit and integration tests. The following mapping is recommended:

| COBOL Test Category | Node.js Test Type | Implementation |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Menu Navigation (TC-001-009) | Unit Tests | Test menu option validation, input handling |
| Balance Operations (TC-002-005, TC-010, TC-030-031) | Unit Tests | Test balance retrieval, display formatting |
| Credit Operations (TC-011-014, TC-019, TC-023, TC-027-028) | Unit Tests | Test transaction processing, decimal precision |
| Debit Operations (TC-015-022, TC-024, TC-026, TC-029) | Unit Tests | Test withdrawal logic, overdraft validation |
| Data Persistence (TC-025, TC-034) | Integration Tests | Test data storage and retrieval across sessions |
| End-to-End Workflows (TC-025, TC-032-035) | Integration Tests | Test complete user scenarios |
